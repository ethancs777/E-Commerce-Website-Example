# E-Commerce Website Example

This website is a basic front-end showing dummy data for items that would be part of an online store. 
The API used to import the data is Fake Store API, which is available online publicly and for free.
As of right now, the webpage has very minimal styling applied, most of the styling is to get the elements in place, more colorful and aesthetic features will come later.

The webpage includes a login to simulate a user logging into the website and then keeps the name in local storage to cache the name until the user logs out. Logging out simply removes the username from local storage.
The webpage also includes a simulated checkout in which the user can add items to the cart, remove items, change the quantity of items, and clear the entire cart all together.
